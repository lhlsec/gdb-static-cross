# Use this as an activate script when working with a non-musl and non-openwrt
# toolchain. You may need to hack it a bit. It's up to you whether it is worth
# using. It works without modification on the Realtek SDK (rsdk) as well as a
# few other "proprietary" prebuilt toolchains. There will be hiccups depending
# on how the toolchains were prepared- for example, some toolchains have multiple
# versions of libraries for different ABIs and byte-orders. You will have to
# work this out yourself (it's not hard)
#

#
# This file should be placed in /path/to/installed/toolchain/
# Within this directory, you should have lib/ usr/ and other things
# as well as something named for the target, i.e. mips-linux-uclibc
# or sometimes, just mips-linux
#
# If this doesn't work for you, you either have it in the wrong directory
# or you have a very odd toolchain.
#
# You should probably call it activate, but it doesn't matter
# All you need to do is source it (from anywhere) and it sets your env up for
# building software via build systems like configure or just via gcc/g++/as/ld
# commands. It helps with static linking by setting some static library paths
# also (See the XXX_STATIC variables)
#
# It makes assumptions and will try to set things up for you so you can
# conveniently build things with or without ./configure based build systems
