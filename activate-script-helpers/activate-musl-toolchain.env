# This is not for you if you are not using a musl-cross-make toolchain
# This is a productivity script that should be sourced from a Bash shell
#
# It is meant to be used after making and installing a musl toolchain using
# the excellent musl-cross-make tool by Rich Felker:
#
#	https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make
#
# This file should be placed in /path/to/installed/toolchain/
# You should probably call it activate, but it doesn't matter
# All you need to do is source it (from anywhere) and it sets your env up for
# building software via build systems like configure or just via gcc/g++/as/ld
# commands. It helps with static linking by setting some static library paths
# also (See the XXX_STATIC variables)
#
# It makes assumptions and will try to set things up for you so you can
# conveniently build things with or without ./configure based build systems
#
# Some of this was stolen from the virtualenv `activate` script :)
